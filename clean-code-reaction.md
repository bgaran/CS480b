One thing that is something you should not do that I tend to do is have a function do more than one thing. 
Especially if those things are related or somewhat related, I often have one method that completes several different tasks.  
I also tend to use alot of parameters.. definitely way more than the 2 max that is recommended. 

One point that suprised me was using pronounceable names.  Both myself and many of my professors tend to use abbreviated 
names such as xLoc, yLoc, xPos, yPos, etc... 

I disagree with the pronounceable names.  I think that as long as the names are clear and descriptive, 
it shouldn't matter if they can be pronounce outloud.  I think that xLoc and yLoc for example are perfectly valid variable names that are easily understood and descriptive enough for anyone to figure out what those variables represent.
